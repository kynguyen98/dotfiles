    I am Ky Nguyen, my friend called me John, I'm an undergraduate who studies engineer. In the summer of 2018, I discovered one of my friends uses Ubuntu on his laptop, and suddenly I decided to give it a try. Since that, I began to distro-hopping to find the distro that I love. Then I found Arch Linux which is a very customizable and light-weighted distro that I've been using ever since.</p>
